### Relaunch with a Stout

This is the relaunch of my beer blog where I will post a few articles about my home brewing experiences from south London.

I have just bottled my 12th brew which is an oatmeal stout! This is my first attempt brewing any type of stout. The main reason for this is winter is coming and I recently I have been drinking more stouts in the pub so it would be a good chance to attempt one myself. Also I have just moved into a new flat where there isn't a wide choice of beer on the shelves yet.
