Yeast: The Practical Guide to Beer Fermentation

To improve my knowledge of what is happening under the hood of my fermentor while the airlock is bubbling away I purchased this book.

I knew this book would go cover some concepts I covered in my biology lessons at school, hopefully I can cope.
Nope bang! in the second chapter you are reading about the yeast cell structure and yeast's metabolism during the fermentation process. I had to review some of these concepts(watched a few biology youtube videos) but even though the formulas looked daunting after conquering them I felt maybe I am starting understand this little fungi called yeast.

The book describes the most common strains and their characteristics, this will be useful for a later date to decided on what strain to choose for when designing a new beer.

One part that did surprise me was the use of mutiple strains of yeast in one beer. I personally thought before hand that no one would do this on purpose. A brewer may choose to use two yeasts for a high gravitiy beer with the first yeast chosen for flavour and the second just there to complete hit the FG(Final Gravity) target while not impacting the flavour created by the first yeast.

I have been meaning to calculate whether I have been pitching the correct amount of yeast per brew the book and how to create a starter to increae the likelyhood of the beer reaching the desired FG. This is an area I can definitely improve on to hopefully make a better beer.

The latter sections of the books give guidance on how to set up a mini lab up to aid the brewery this is wonderful but in reality I imagine many homebrewers do not have the space to do this. However there a few tests that anyone could do to ensure their brewing set up is sufficent at each stage. 

The first test is the "Forced Wort Test": This test involves collecting a small amount wort and pitching yeast into this wort in a separate container. This container should be kept at a warmer temperature than normal fermentaiton ideally around 30 degrees. The higher temperature is in order to help any containments within the wort grow quicker. This test is to see if there any containmenets presence on the hot side of your brewing set up. If after one day the container becomes hazy this is evidence this is an issue while 7 days later if there is no evidence of containmentation build up you have a clean set up!


The second test is the "Forced wort test": The aim of this test is to find the maximum attenuation of the yeast by raising the temperature and constant stirring. This can help the brewer find out roughly what the FG of the expected beer to be and make alterations if required.


Moving forward this book explains in depth how important it is for any brewer to take care of their yeast to create wonderful beers. I highly recommond this book and imagine I will be reading it a few more times in my brewing ventures to improve how I use yeast and how I can maybe even develop my own unique tasting strain.
